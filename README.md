# Halo-Reach-Font
A True Type Font mimicking the Halo Reach logo by Bungie.

By: UncookedMoa

(Based on designs by drummer0702)

>:/TRANSMISSION START/:

At last, 8 years after its release (at the time of typing this readme), a font based on Bungie's 2010 Halo logo revision for Halo Reach finally exists. Every letter has been updated and designed by drummer0702.

This font also includes updated "4" and "5" numbers, in accordance with the logo designs of Halo 4 and 5. Since this is the "Reach" font - in other words: Bungie's vision - Every other number has been left untouched. The numbers in the logo for Halo 2 and 3 are still here, and numbers 6-9 are borrowed from Will Turnbow's Halo font designs that the Halo community has been using up till now.

I apologize for any imperfections you may spot. This is the first font I've ever made (therefore, an amateur), and I never went to a calligraphy class. I am simply trying to provide my services by providing a new Halo font that should have already existed years ago. If any one would like to improve the font, feel free to do so. I have provided the starting point, now more experienced font creators can polish it up further.

As with Will Turnbow's Halo font, this font is free to use. Use it however you'd like, whenever you'd like and feel free to modify it!

>:/THE STORY BEHIND THE FONT/:

In 2010, a Bungie.net forum user going by the username of drummer0702 designed a font based on Halo Reach's changes to the Halo logo: https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Post/2499511

Unfortunately, instead of following up with the final ttf file, he went dark and was never heard from again. Years followed and nobody ever implemented the designs into an actual font, to the point that even the image itself was lost, due to Imageshack's mass deletion of image files.

I (UncookedMoa) luckily had this saved on my hard drive and recently found it as I was checking my old hard drives for any interesting content. Upon seeing the Reach font concepts, I decided to delve into font creation, making a font based on these designs drummer0702 made. After a few adjustments, viola. The Halo Reach font was born.

I am available on Discord as UncookedMoa#9730 (Profile picture with a Moa logo) and also have a YouTube channel of the same name. I mainly create music videos and trailers, however. Focus is not necessarily Halo, but most of the content is definitely Halo. I also happen to have a channel dedicated to archiving fan made Halo music, known as "AwesomeHaloMusic." You can check either of the two channels out, if you'd like.

>:/OTHER FONTS BY UNCOOKEDMOA HALO FANS WILL BE INTERESTED IN/:

- Halo 3 Font Fixed
It's Will Turnbow's Halo 3 font, but with the question mark finally fixed. For too long have we worked with an upside down question mark in the Halo 3 font. No more.

- Halo 5 Font: 
A completely new font based on 343's own version of the Halo font. Letters and numbers have all been overhauled, including the characters for the numbers "2" and "3", for hypothetical "Anniversary" designs. The number "2" is not lifted from Halo 2 Anniversary, however, in favor of a custom design. I personally felt that the "2" in Halo 2 Anniversary's trailers was out of place for the Halo font, looking as though it was a different font entirely.
While bearing many similarities, the prime difference between Halo Reach and 5's logos is that Halo Reach's logo is more "pointy" while Halo 5's is sleeker, with more diagonal lines. This Halo 5 font is of my own design, and was made after some practice with the Halo Reach font. As such, I personally feel this was better made than the Reach font.
